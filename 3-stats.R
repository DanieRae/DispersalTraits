#With the clustering of the species here a a few responses that should be looked at#

#FOR how much over redundancy in each cluster is there? Does the pattern of over redundancy change spatially? How many FEs have just one species? Is there a clear pattern in what characteristics have only 1 species? What are the ecological services provided by FE groups with high FOR vs those with none? Do we see change over time (quick/slow/more or less diversity in different areas), larger home ranges, higher dispersal capabilitys in certian FEs?

#Include abundance distributions (biomass) across FE's, before and during collapse 

#How does the FE diversity compare to hill numbers locally (alpha and gamma) gradients of beta accross the space
